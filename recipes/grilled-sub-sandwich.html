    <h2>Can eat a leviathan?</h2>
    <p>
      After a long hard day at band camp, my daughter comes home with a huge<br />
      appetite. This sandwich not only satisfies my hungry marcher; it is
      also<br />
      fast and easy to prepare. -Char Shanahan Schererville, Indiana

      <li>
        Cut loaf in half horizontally; remove bread from top half, leaving a<br />
        1/2-in. shell (discard removed bread or save for another use). Brush
        cut<br />
        sides of loaf with salad dressing; place cut side down on grill.
